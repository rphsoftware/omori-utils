# More than 4 skils

- Patch plugin
- NOT SELF COMPATIBLE, MAKE SURE YOU EITHER USE THE SAME NAME AS IN THE REPO OR HAVE SOME OTHER WAY OF DETECTING COMPAT
- Usage:
  - In RPGMaker when you want to raise the skill limit for a given actor, run a script command with `this.set_override(<actor id>, <number>)`, for instance `this.set_override(1, 6);` to give OMORI 6 skill slots
